    <p><h3>Description:</h3></p>
    <p>This is another recipe I enjoy making for my wife.</p>

    <p>I like to think it makes her life easier.</p>
    <p><h4>Ingredients:</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>500g White Flour</li>
        <li>300g Tepid Water</li>
        <li>11g Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>5g Instant Yeast</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Directions:</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Allow yeast to bloom for 10 minutes in the tepid water before adding remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Allow your stand mixer to beat up the dough for 10 minutes before allowing two 1 hour rounds of rising (broken up by deflating and shaping).</li>
        <li>Bake at 375F until the internal temperature hits 195F (approximately 30-40 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Wait and hour for the bread to cool and rest before slicing!</li>
